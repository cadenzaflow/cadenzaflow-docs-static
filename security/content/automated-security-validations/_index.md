CadenzaFlow employs a multi-stage automated security validation pipeline covering source code, dependencies, and deployment artifacts. Each stage provides independent scan reports and metrics to ensure the platform’s integrity and compliance throughout its lifecycle.

Sharing the results of these validations reflects our commitment to transparency and our dedication to making CadenzaFlow a Workflow Management System built for true enterprise-grade use, where security, reliability, and operational excellence are foundational principles.
