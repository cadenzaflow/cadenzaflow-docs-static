On this page, CadenzaFlow provides announcements of known vulnerabilities for which fix releases and/or practical workarounds are available. Simply, this page publishes security notices _after_ fixes are available.

Fixes are available as:

* Either as alpha/minor releases of the CadenzaFlow Community Edition
* Or as patches to the CadenzaFlow Enterprise, Embedded/OEM Edition
